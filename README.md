This is a weekly workout app I made while working with Wiley Edge in 2020.
These are the technologies,tools and languages I used to create the app: Android Studio/VS Code/Visual Studio, Firebase Realtime database, Java
The app offers a weekly workout routine that pulls exercises from a realtime database to build an efficient workout and can be tailored to anyone from any experience level.
Each day is focused on a particular muscle group with Sunday being a rest day.
To use the app all you need to do is select the day of the week. From there a workout will be fetched from the database. If the workout is too simple, you can change the difficulty of the workout and it will give you one that is more challenging.
